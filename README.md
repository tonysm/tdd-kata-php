# TDD kata in PHP

This repo is just for training.

If you want to try some of the katas, then follow the instructions bellow:

* First, copy the folder <code>default</code>, like so: <code>cp -R default new-kata</code>
* Then run <code>npm install</code> as well as <code>composer install --dev</code> inside the new folder
* Now you can run <code>$ ./vendo/bin/phpspec run</code> on your own or use gulp like so: <code>$ gulp</code>

## Note

When using gulp, your tests are going to run automatically whenever you save your specs files or php files.
Also, you are going to get a notification if the tests passed or failed. To change the icons edit the "test" task inside the <code>Gulpfile.js</code> file.
